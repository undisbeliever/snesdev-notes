snes-test-roms/inidisp_forgot_to_force_blank_2.sfc


I have observed over 10 different outputs when executing the same
`inidisp_forgot_to_force_blank_2.sfc` binary and resetting the console.


The screen captures on the left are from my 3-chip 2/1/3 SFC console.

The screen captures on the right are from my 1-chip SFC console.
